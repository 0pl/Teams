Team Features

Advancement Sharing (toggleable)

Similar to that of the popular mod "Together Forever"
Should work very consistently, I don't even have a force sync command because it should never be required.
Advancements sync whenever a teammate joins the world, joins the team, gets an advancement, etc.

HUD Overlay (toggleable)

HUD overlay shows you the status (health/hunger) and location of nearby teammates
In addition to being toggleable in the config, you can temporarily hide the HUD by pressing "v" by default

Commands

/team create <teamname> : creates team of "teamname" and automatically adds you to it
/team invite <playername> : invites player "playername" to your team

/team list : lists all teams
/team info <teamname> : lists all players in team "teamname"
