This mod is for Forge 1.12.2

 

Team Features

Advancement Sharing (toggleable)

Similar to that of the popular mod "Together Forever"
Included in the mod just so people don't have to have multiple teams in multiple different mods and I know it's a popular feature
Should work very consistently, I don't even have a force sync command because it should never be required.
Advancements sync whenever a teammate joins the world, joins the team, gets an advancement, etc.
HUD Overlay (toggleable)

HUD overlay shows you the health and hunger of nearby alive teammates
HUD updates every 30 ticks and shows up to 5 nearby teammates
In addition to being toggleable in the config, you can temporarily hide the HUD by pressing "v" by default



Commands

/team create <teamname> : creates team of "teamname" and automatically adds you to it
/team invite <playername> : invites player "playername" to your team
/team accept : accepts invitation to a team
/team list : lists all teams
/team info <teamname> : lists all players in team "teamname"
/team player <playername> : gets team of player <playername>
/team remove <teamname> : removes the team "teamname" 
 

Teams GUI

Teams button appears in inventory screen (with toggleable size)

This button opens a menu allowing you to:

Create a team (showing you the taken team names)
Invite a player to your team (showing nearby eligible players)
Leave your team
List teams and players within them
Transfer items to players within your team (in range of 100 blocks or so. No more dropping items on the ground!)
